Doom Keycard inspired PCB, micro-edition with ATmega328P

I created a mini key card which is insprired by the Door Key Cards found in the original Doom game.

* Features
  * Measures 24.5mm long x 17.8mm high (1 inch x .7 inch).
  * Uses 0402 size parts for a good SMT soldering challenge.
  * Adding recommended components will allow it to run as an Arduino Uno clone (minus serial-usb).
  * All Arduino pins route to a pad.
  * Open Source!  Modify and embelish as desired.
  * Made with Eagle CAD
